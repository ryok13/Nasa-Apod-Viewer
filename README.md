# Nasa Apod Viewer

## 📓 Description
This is a simple web app that allows users to explore NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) using NASA's public API. They can view today's image, search by a specific date, get random images, or explore a range of dates.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔭 Load today's APOD image
- 📅 Search by a specific date
- 🔀 Get multiple random images (1–10)
- 🗓️ Search by a date range (start_date and end_date)
- 🖼️ Filter only image media (video or other types are excluded)
- ⚠️ Displays error messages if fetch fails or if the media is not an image

## 📸 Demo (ex. Load today's APOD image)
    ※ I used my own API key instead of "DEMO_KEY".
